Worked on including a new library called milk to the Machine Learning Benchmarks. Wrote the installation files for the library along with Implementations and Unit Tests for Kmeans, Random Forest, Adaboost, Decision Tree, Perceptron and Logistic Regression. Also made a minor fix to the config.yaml file.
