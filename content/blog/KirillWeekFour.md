During the fourth week I was working on a class that implements a simple
cross-validation strategy. The strategy by itself is not difficult to
implement, but supporting different types of machine learning algorithms is a
bit tricky. It also would be nice to design a solution that could be re-used by
other cross-validation strategies. It takes a bit more time than I initially
planed (now I plan to finish it on this week), but hopefully a good design will
save some time latter.
