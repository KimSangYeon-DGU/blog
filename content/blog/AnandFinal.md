And its done! We have crossed the pencils down date and final evaluations are on roll!  

This last week, I spent some time scrubbing, polishing and reviewing the code. Made some changes where things were looking cluttered specially in the make reports code. I also wrote a wiki page describing, in detail, the work done this Summer to improve the benchmarking system. The wiki page can be found in the benchmarks git repository. 

All in all, it was an awesome experience working with and for Mlpack, this GSoC! Also, it was so nice to have interacted with and learnt from Marcus and Ryan. I hope the work done this Summer proves to be useful to the library and to others. No doubts, I would like to come back and work more!

Bidding adieu to GSoC, 2014!
