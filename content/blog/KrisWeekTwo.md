This week we pushed our existing implementations to mlpack. We are now done with Basic Wrapper Layer for RBM the base visible and hidden layer. We also are done with the Cd-k and and PCd-k algorithm. This week will be spent in writing test for the Binary RBM layer. I will also try to complete the ssRBM this would be easy since we have to only edit the visible layer for this hopefully. Currently we are facing some diffculties in the storage of the parameters that are shared by the visible and hidden layer. But we expect to finish that by this week. 

Here are the links to the works
