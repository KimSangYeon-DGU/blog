During the ninth week I was primarily working on the classification metrics
(precision, recall, and F1) for the cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning
modules. The work is almost done - [the
PR](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1074) has been made, it has been
reviewed, and the requested changes have been added.

Now I'm going to add changes requested in my previous PRs, as well as to start
working on adding support for the mlpack optimizers in the hyper-parameter
tuning module.
