It has been a week since the GSoC coding period officially started and the fun has already begun! 
Here are some highlights of the work that I did on my project this week:

* Started implementing the proposed metrics.
* The following metrics have already been implemented:

	* Accuracy
	* Precision
	* Recall
	* F Measure
	* Lift

* I also added an implementation of the Confusion Matrix and its graphical visualization to make other implementations easier.

The next week will see further implementations of more metrics. 

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
