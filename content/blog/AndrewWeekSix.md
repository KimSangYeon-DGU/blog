As regards my program:

Last week, while I was debugging the tree construction, I noticed something interesting.  All of the sudden, I was able to write the code I wanted without looking up every other function.  While I had expected to learn how to do this as I grew more familiar with the code, I found it quite interesting that this happened so rapidly.  It was almost like one day I was still trying to write tree.numPoints and then the next I realized I wanted tree.NumDescendants().  Very interesting.  I don't really have any idea why it happened, but it reminded me of Bobby Fisher's quote in re. chess: "One day, I just got good."

Sadly, this happened while I was debugging tree construction.  A short while later (perhaps as a result of not having to look things up) I had the construction working, and now I need to learn a new set of code--the neighbor_search_rules.

So the current state is that it runs but it doesn't work.  I'm not sure if I prefer that to throwing error messages at me, but I guess we'll see how long it takes me to figure out how the neighbor search rules work.
