My work is to implement neural evolution algorithms that can be furthur extended to NES games and other artificial neural network optimization.
Later on benchmarking and comparing various algorithms like CNE , NEAT, Hyper-NEAT and CMAES.

I have gone through CMA-ES algorithm for neural evolution learning and have decided to implement it as an optimizer after 
discussing it with my mentor. 

Went through the research paper by Mr. Hansen for CMAES understanding this algorithm deeper which took a lot of time.

Went through doxygen documentation and implementation.

Read the existing optimizer codes for eg. stochastic gradient descend.

Read the ann code as well.

Started coding for CMAES.

and the task for next week is to complete CMAES along with tests.
