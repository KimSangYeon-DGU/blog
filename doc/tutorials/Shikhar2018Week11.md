@section Shikhar2018Week11 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 11

This week the progress had been relatively slow. I had to commute back to my college, and set-up my hostel room, and get a lot of administrative work done for the upcoming semester. Given the unbearable summer heat of this country, it really becomes an annoying job.

Nevertheless, we finally merged the `RBM` PR, and pushed another request for the `SSRBM` test on `CIFAR-10` dataset, which should be ready to merged by this week. After this, we can shift our focus back to the `DualOptimizer` PR, and get that merged as well. That's all I have.
