@section Shikhar2018Week13 Implementing Essential Deep Learning Modules - Week 12 and 13

We're finally here at the end of our `GSoC` journey. During the last two weeks as well, the progress had been a bit slow, as I became more involved in my semester studies and preparing for my industrial internship interviews.

We are currently still in progress with the `CIFAR-10` test on `SSRBM`, and the `DualOptimizer` PR. I had a talk with Atharva with respect to refactoring the `Gradients()` method of the `Convolution` and `AtrousConvolution` layers. The PR is review ready and should be merged shortly.

Apart from these two tasks, we have been experiencing a test failure of the `RBM` module on the `mlpack` testbench, which we are investigating as well. These tasks would be worked upon after the `GSoC` period ends. I also had a couple of additional goals that I wished to implement, namely `StackGAN`, `SeqGAN` and `Deep Belief Networks`. I hope to stay with the community, and keep contributing to its infrastructure.

`הֱיה שלום`
