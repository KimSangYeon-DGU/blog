The midterm evaluations are already over. And the good news is : I have passed the evaluation!

This week, I worked on writing the necessary code for logistic regression. For now we have added logistic regression with the metrics to :

* Mlpack
* Scikit
* Shogun
* Matlab

I am still working on getting things working for weka. Hopefully, I will do it soon. Next week, I plan to start linear regression and HMM.

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
