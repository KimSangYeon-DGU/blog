@section Udit2015WeekSix Implementation of Multi-Class Adaboost Algorithm (Code Review for the Decision Stump) - Week 6

So with the Perceptron done, I finally got to the code review of the decision stump and good for that, for it seems I had the Entropy Calculation a little differently thought out than Ryan - now it's done more efficiently. I also ended up adding another unit test which checked whether the correct attribute had been chosen as the splitting attribute.

Hopefully this covers the Decision Stump. I still have the Perceptron code review, up next week. And I'm finally getting started with the AdaBoost algorithm. I'm still coming up with a convincing design, but it shouldn't be too hard. 

Next week then !
