And we have almost come half way through! It seems that within no time, the midterm evaluation will start!

This week, I worked on integrating the metrics with the remaining libraries too. Finally, integration for the following libraries has been done:

* Mlpack
* Scikit
* Weka
* Shogun
* Matlab

The metrics currently work only for the Naive Bayes Classifier in all the above libraries. So, the next task that I would take up is to make them work for some other methods as well. I will start the work for logistic regression this week. It will be fun!

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
