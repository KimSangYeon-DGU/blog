@section Anand2016Week9 Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week 9

Another week gone! The last week was a bit more interesting in terms of the work done because I started a new item from my proposal and it seems that it would be working soon!

I left Mlpy linear regression while integrating with the benchmarking framework. Now, that is done!

The next and one of the most important thing that I started was the Bootstrapping framework. I added a new task called 'bootstrap' in the run_benchmark code and a new print functionality to print the bootstrapping results as a table. This new task will help us analyze the performance of various methods of various libraries in consideration for each metric so that we can rank the libraries as well as methods and also improve performance wherever needed.

For the next week, I am planning to work a bit more on Bootstrapping and complete it.

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
