@section Wenhao2018Week08 Alternatives to Neighborhood-Based CF - Week 8

This week I was working on implementation of `BiasSVD` and `SVD++`. As `BiasSVD` model is very similar to `RegularizedSVD` model, `class BiasSVD` is implemented by modifying `class RegularizedSVD`. To test whether it works I have added some simple tests and I will complete all tests later.

Besides, I also worked on `SVDPlusPlus` and wrapper classes for these two new models (i.e. `BiasSVDPolicy` and `SVDPlusPlusPolicy`). These are also close to be completed. I will finish the remaining work and push the codes after my trip back from Europe:)
