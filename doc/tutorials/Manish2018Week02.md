@section Manish2018Week02 LMNN (via Low-Rank optimization) & BoostMetric Implementation - Week 2

Last week LMNN initial implementation was completed to a great extent. The results were comparable to the other LMNN implementations. Currently, we are going over the different parts of the implementation to gain speedups and efficiency. Some unit tests for checking the correctness of LMNN and constraints were written as well. It may happen that some of these tests would not show up in the final implementation, or some others may be included as we progress.

Furthermore, we decided to benchmark the current implementation and hence, a linux instance was set up by Ryan. Shortly we will have the results.

The coming week, we will work on finalizing the implementation. Mostly, some algo improvements and hacks are needed to be taken care of. Conversion of the distance matrix to low-dimensional form will also be done.
