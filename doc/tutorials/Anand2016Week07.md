@section Anand2016Week7 Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week 7 + 8

Alright, I am back! I was travelling home last week and couldn't work much. So, this week I resumed and completed some pending work. We also had our second merge with the master!

So, I worked on integrating the metrics with linear regression as well as logistic regression. We have been able to completely integrate with the following libraries :

* Mlpack
* Scikit
* Shogun
* Matlab
* Weka

Yes, there were a lot of bugs to fix this week! Me and Marcus worked on getting the errors right before merging so that we can avoid any build failures. It was an awesome week, altogether!

For the next week, I am planning to take HMM. HMM has been implemented only in Mlpack and Matlab. So, I guess, it should not take much time. Morever, I am planning to start working on the Bootstrapping framework for the benchmarking system that I suggested in my proposal. Let us bring out the best!

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
