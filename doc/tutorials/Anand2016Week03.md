@section Anand2016Week3 Improvement of Automatic Benchmarking System - Week 3

And another week has gone! It seems that the time is moving really fast and we too are moving at a good pace with the GSoC project!

This week, I added the following to the benchmarking system:

* Conversions from binary to multi-class for all the metrics implemented
* More unit tests for the new methods implemented

This week, I worked on the class conversion problem and it was really nice discussing some of the problems which did not even have any standard solution.
We worked our way out with some critical and logical thinking and finally implemented the solutions to this problem. Undoubtedly, it was another fun week!

The next week we will try to make the metrics work for some other libraries too.

Thank you for visiting and feel free to catch me on IRC regarding any queries about the project or even for a quick chat!
