@section Kartik2017WeekFourFive Neural Evolution Algorithms for NES games - Week 4 + 5

All this time me and Marcus were improving the CMAES code using armadillo functions. We optimised everything to armadillo library, alot of changes are made to the library and now its written like other mlpack optimizers. The algorithm is a bit complex and I struggled with errors a lot of time. This also includes more than 150 style checks corrected and making the test case pass for the algorithm.
finally everything looks correct for now and all builds are passing.

During this time ive also made a blog post on CMAES algorithm on medium which u can see here [medium blog post](https://medium.com/@kkstrack/cmaes-algorithm-in-c-using-mlpack-1a233af7a1f7)

the next week will be spend adding more test cases like logistic regression and rosenbrock function and also testing the code on a neural network.
