This week, I spent time in reading C++ template constructs, and syntactic details that were necessary to understand ann code. I got stuck mostly in this part in starting days of week. I have gained some insight on how template template parameters, rvalues and some template types and other features work, which are used so much in the code. I am still in process of completely understanding the code, which I hope to do in coming days by taking help of others.

Also I have completed a first implementation of Inception Layer just about today. I still need to write a small test to check if it works which I will do next. After this completes we will discuss the plan of coming week in the next days.
