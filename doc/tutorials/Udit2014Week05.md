@section Udit2015WeekFive Implementation of Multi-Class Adaboost Algorithm (Implementing the Perceptron) - Week 5

Almost halfway ! 

This week I got off to implementing the Perceptron. It was pretty straightforward, and although I had a few problems getting the learning policy - the weight matrix update method wrong a few times, after catching up on some literature online, I had that fixed up in no time. 
After a basic perceptron with a simple weight update had been coded, along with relevant tests, I was ready to extend using templates and provide functionalities for the Weight Matrix initialization methods and Learn Policy/ Update Algorithms. 

As of now, almost everything is done for the perceptron except the learn policy templates - documentation, weights initialization, and unit tests.

I'm planning to finish the perceptron by Tuesday and get ready with my final submission for the mid terms by Wednesday. Also, I have to start reading and designing the AdaBoost algorithm.
