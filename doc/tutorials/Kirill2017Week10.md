@section Kirill2017WeekTen Cross-Validation and Hyper-Parameter Tuning - Week 10

During the week I was primarily putting the finishing touches to the
cross-validation code. To my delight [the simple cross-validation
strategy](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1044) finally got merged. I
should be able to add final edits to [k-fold
cross-validation](https://github.com/micyril/mlpack/pull/1) shortly, so,
hopefully it will be ready to be merged soon.

I'm also working with my mentor on getting [the hyper-parameter
tuner](https://github.com/micyril/mlpack/pull/2) merged. Now it's hard to
predict how much time it will take to finish with it.
