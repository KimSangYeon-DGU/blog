@section Yasmine2018CBP Automatically-Generated Go Bindings - Community Bonding Period

For GSOC 2018, I will be implementing an automated-binding generator for mlpack. During the Community Bonding Period, I have decided to change the language of the binding generator. Instead of Java, I will be implementing it for Go. I think Go will be an interesting addition to the mlpack bindings as it not verbose and has the expressiveness of dynamic languages while  maintaining the performance of compiled language.

The last two weeks have been used to read the documentation in more depth and better understand the python bindings that already are in place, as a similar approach will be used for Go. I have also research how to use C++ in Go, and how to use cgo more precisely. This week I will start building a small prototype and start playing with calling C++ code from Go, and passing C++ memory from and to Go.
