@section Andrew2016Six Implementation of tree types - Lest any thought should go unrecorded - Week 3

Well, not much news here, hopefully the R tree will be functional in the next few days.  I think I have C++
or quasi-C++ code for it "finished" and am currently trying to compile and test it.  Overall it's been fairly
straighforward so far.  There were a few places with interesting design choices, but it was mostly read a paper,
implement their algorthim, read another paper.  The tree only supports points rather than points and rectangles
since I don't know of any applications in machine learning where you would want rectangles, but they shouldn't be
too hard to add later on if I need to do so.  You may have noticed--if you had too much coffee or don't do enough
work--that I successfully avoided ending that last sentence with a preposition.  It makes me feel pretty good
about myself, and I may write a book on it later, but for now, it's back to debugging C++ templates.
