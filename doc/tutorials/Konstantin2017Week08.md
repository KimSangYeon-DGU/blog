@section Konstantin2017WeekEight Augmented Recurrent Neural Networks - Week 8

Unlike previous weeks, this week was rather quiescent. It didn't feature insane bugs, weird behaviors of the code, mind-boggling compiler messages and anything else of the kind.

However, it featured a work on "casting" gradient clipping and cross-entropy performance function to the `mlpack` standard API. The pull request with the entire discussion: [link](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1070). As mentioned in the discussion of the PR, this code is more or less ready for merging into `mlpack/master`.
