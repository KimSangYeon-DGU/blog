@section Udit2015WeekThree Implementation of Multi-Class Adaboost Algorithm - Week 3

Week Three over now (picking up the pace, now !); halfway into my fourth Week and I'm into writing tests for decision stumps, along with working on the implementation of the Simple Perceptron.

Having just gotten over with testing decision stumps, it just dawned on me that a good test really goes a long way in developing structurally stable programs. Now, when I start about optimizations and tuning, a good test seems to be an extremely handy tool by my side.

Writing documentation also really helps when you start debugging and you really feel it when you need your own documentation to get over code you wrote, hardly over a week ago !

I also fixed the binning and splitting criterion in the code - there seemed to be some problems with generating upper and lower bounds of the bins - along with sorting out extreme cases here and there.
