@section Kirill2017WeekEight Cross-Validation and Hyper-Parameter Tuning - Week 8

During the eighth week I was finishing working on the hyper-parameter tuning
module. Some minor changes still should be added, but basically it is done.
Since [the pull request on the simple cross-validation
strategy](https://github.com/mlpack/mlpack/pull/1044) is not merged yet, I need
to wait before sending a pull request for the hyper-parameter tuning module. By
now it is [available](https://github.com/micyril/mlpack/pull/2) in my fork of
mlpack. The same goes for [k-fold
cross-validation](https://github.com/micyril/mlpack/pull/1).

The main part of my GSoC plan is almost done, so I'm going to work on some
optional parts. For the nearest time it will be additional metrics for the
cross-validation and hyper-parameter tuning modules like precision, recall and
F1.
