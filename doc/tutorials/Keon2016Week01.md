@section Keon2016SWeekOne Dataset and Experimentation Tools - Week 1

The goal of the Dataset and Experimentation Tools project is to create utilities for dataset management in mlpack.
The first week of GSoC went really quick. Here are some highlights I did:

- Started implementing proof-of-concept for managing missing values. (more should be discussed)
- Implemented CLI executable wrapper for data split and added split function for unlabeled data.
- With Tham, discussed and planned about APIs for dataset management functions. (such as binarize, encoding, normalization, etc)

Since I've been coding in JavaScript lately, it took me some time to quickly recap C++ and get used to the new environment, but it was really enjoyable.
Next week, I am going to finalize working on missing data feature and analyze more into working with categorical features.
