@section Dewang2017WeekOne Updating Scikit Libraries - Week 1

The scikit implementations of LSHForest, AllKnn, Elastic Net, GMM, ICA, Kernel_PCA, KMeans, Logistic Regression and Sparse Encoding were updated to include more options like min_hash_match, radius and radius_cutoff_ratio for LSHForest; radius, tree_type, minkowski parameter and n_jobs for AllKnn; fit_intercept, normalize, precompute, max_iter, copy_X, tolerance and selection for ElasticNet; n_components, algorithm, fun, max_iter and tolerance for ICA and similarly more options were included for other algorithms as well to make the implementations up to date with the scikit 0.18.1.


Certain minor fixes were also made to the config.yaml file like including Logistic Regression block under scikit block of the file.

Also, I am really glad to be a part of a cool community like mlpack.
